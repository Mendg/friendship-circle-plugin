# EOS Rocks

Rocks are the 3-7 most important priorities that must get done in the next 90 days. They come from the EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) framework and represent the critical few things that will move the business forward significantly.

## What Makes a Good Rock

A well-defined Rock has these characteristics:

**SMART Framework:**
- **Specific:** Clear, unambiguous outcome
- **Measurable:** You know when it's done (binary complete/incomplete)
- **Achievable:** Possible within 90 days with available resources
- **Relevant:** Directly supports annual goals or solves a critical issue
- **Time-bound:** Due by end of quarter

**Core Principles:**
- **Completion-based, not task-based:** "Launch new website" not "Work on website"
- **Outcome-focused:** What's achieved, not just activities
- **Significant impact:** Moving this forward moves the business forward
- **Single owner:** One person accountable (though they may delegate)
- **Binary done/not done:** No ambiguity about completion

## Common Rock Pitfalls

**Too vague:**
❌ "Improve customer experience"
✅ "Implement new onboarding flow with 90%+ customer satisfaction score"

**Too many actions, not an outcome:**
❌ "Have 12 sales meetings and send 50 follow-up emails"
✅ "Close 3 enterprise deals totaling $150K ARR"

**Ongoing operations disguised as Rocks:**
❌ "Manage team effectively"
✅ "Complete performance reviews for all 8 direct reports"

**Too small (this is a to-do, not a Rock):**
❌ "Schedule quarterly planning meeting"
✅ "Complete and communicate 2025 strategic plan to all stakeholders"

**Too big (this is multi-quarter or an annual goal):**
❌ "Build entire new product line"
✅ "Launch MVP of Product X to 50 beta customers"

## The Rock Development Process

### Phase 1: Discovery - Identify Potential Rocks

Ask strategic questions to surface what matters most:

**From Annual Goals:**
- "What are your company's annual goals or vision?"
- "What 3-7 things must happen this quarter to stay on track for annual goals?"

**From Issues:**
- "What critical issues or problems are holding the business back?"
- "Which issues, if solved this quarter, would have the biggest impact?"

**From Opportunities:**
- "What opportunities are available right now that won't be there in 6 months?"
- "What could you accomplish this quarter that would create momentum?"

**From Roles:**
- "What are the most important outcomes for your role this quarter?"
- "What's only you can do vs. what your team should handle?"

**Generate a long list (10-20 possibilities).** Don't filter yet—surface everything that could be important.

### Phase 2: Evaluation - Assess Each Potential Rock

For each potential Rock, evaluate on these dimensions:

**Impact Assessment:**
- "If this gets done, how significantly does it move the business forward?"
- "What happens if this doesn't get done this quarter?"
- "Does this support annual goals directly?"

**Feasibility Check:**
- "Is this achievable in 90 days with current resources?"
- "What obstacles or dependencies exist?"
- "Is this the right-sized outcome for a quarter?"

**Clarity Test:**
- "Can you state this as a clear, binary done/not done outcome?"
- "Who would own this?"
- "How will you know it's complete?"

**Category Alignment:**
Rate each potential Rock in these categories:
- **Urgency:** Must happen now vs. can wait (1-10)
- **Impact:** Significance to business results (1-10)
- **Effort:** Resource/time required (1-10, higher = more effort)

### Phase 3: Prioritization - Select 3-7 Rocks

**Apply these filters sequentially:**

1. **Must-haves:** What absolutely must happen this quarter? (Usually 2-4 items)
2. **High-impact opportunities:** What would significantly move the business forward? (1-3 items)
3. **Capacity check:** Is this realistically achievable given team capacity and other priorities?

**Prioritization frameworks:**

**Eisenhower Matrix:**
- Urgent + Important = Rock candidate
- Important but not urgent = Rock candidate (don't let these slip)
- Urgent but not important = Delegate or to-do, not a Rock
- Neither urgent nor important = Drop it

**ROI-based:**
- High impact + Low effort = Prioritize
- High impact + High effort = Include if critical
- Low impact + Low effort = To-do, not Rock
- Low impact + High effort = Avoid

**Help the user narrow from 10-20 possibilities to 3-7 final Rocks.** Push back gently if they try to take on too many—more Rocks means less focus and lower completion rates.

### Phase 4: Refinement - Make Each Rock Crystal Clear

For each selected Rock, refine the statement:

**Format template:**
"[Action verb] [specific outcome] [measurable criteria] by [deadline]"

**Test each Rock:**
- Can someone else read this and know exactly what "done" means?
- Is there a clear owner?
- Is it specific enough to measure completion?
- Is it outcome-based, not just activity-based?

**Before/After Examples:**

Before: "Improve marketing"
After: "Launch paid ad campaign generating 500 qualified leads with <$50 CPA by Q1 end"

Before: "Hire people"
After: "Hire and onboard 2 senior engineers who pass 90-day evaluations by March 31"

Before: "Work on fundraising"
After: "Close $2M Series A round with signed term sheet by February 28"

Before: "Fix operations issues"
After: "Implement new project management system with 100% team adoption and 90%+ satisfaction by March 31"

### Phase 5: Assignment - Ownership and Accountability

For each Rock, clarify:

**Owner:**
- Who is the single person accountable?
- This person doesn't do all the work but owns the outcome
- One owner per Rock (no shared ownership)

**Support:**
- Who else needs to contribute?
- What resources are needed?
- What dependencies exist?

**Milestones:**
- What are 2-3 key milestones to track progress?
- When should each milestone be hit?
- What's the plan to stay on track?

## Working with Different Contexts

### Company-Level Rocks

These typically come from:
- Annual strategic plan
- V/TO (Vision/Traction Organizer)
- Critical company-wide issues
- Major opportunities or threats

Company Rocks should cascade down—if the company commits to launching a new product, that might generate Rocks for product, marketing, and sales leaders.

### Leadership Team Rocks

Each leadership team member (Integrator, Visionary, or department heads) typically has 3-7 Rocks. These should:
- Support company Rocks
- Address department-specific priorities
- Solve critical issues in their domain
- Advance annual departmental goals

### Individual Contributor Rocks

Individual team members might have 1-3 Rocks if they're working on major projects. Criteria:
- Does this project warrant quarterly focus?
- Is this beyond regular job responsibilities?
- Will this take significant time/energy?

If something is just "doing your job," it's not a Rock—it's expected performance.

### Rock vs. To-Do Decision Framework

**It's a Rock if:**
- Takes significant time/effort across the quarter
- Represents a major outcome or milestone
- Completion significantly moves business forward
- Requires focus and prioritization
- One of the most important things you'll do this quarter

**It's a to-do if:**
- Takes less than a week to complete
- Part of normal job responsibilities
- Low impact on business results
- Routine or administrative
- Supporting activity for a larger Rock

## Facilitation Principles

**Ask, don't tell:** Help users discover their Rocks through questions rather than prescribing them.

**Challenge gently:** If a Rock seems too vague, too small, or not outcome-focused, ask questions to help them refine it: "How will you know when that's done?" or "What does success look like specifically?"

**Focus on outcomes:** Keep redirecting from activities to results. "What will be different when this is complete?"

**Encourage boldness:** Rocks should stretch the team. If they're too easy, they're not ambitious enough.

**Maintain the right number:** Push back if someone wants 10+ Rocks. More Rocks = less focus = lower completion. "If you could only choose 3 things to get done this quarter, what would they be?"

**Create clarity:** A good Rock statement should be so clear that anyone reading it knows exactly what "done" means.

**Test the binary nature:** Ask "On December 31st, will this be clearly done or not done? Could there be any ambiguity?" If yes, refine it further.

## Rock Review and Refinement Sessions

When reviewing existing Rocks:

**Weekly Check-ins:**
- "Is this Rock on track, off track, or at risk?"
- "What progress happened this week?"
- "What obstacles emerged?"
- "What support is needed?"

**Monthly Deep Dive:**
- "Looking at the full quarter, is this still the right Rock?"
- "Do we need to adjust the outcome or timeline?"
- "What would it take to get this back on track?"

**When a Rock is struggling:**
- Is the Rock too big/ambitious for the quarter?
- Is the owner the right person?
- Are there dependencies blocking progress?
- Is this still a priority or should we drop it?

**It's okay to adjust Rocks mid-quarter IF:**
- Business circumstances changed significantly
- A Rock becomes irrelevant
- A higher priority emerges
- A Rock was poorly defined initially

**But avoid frequent changes—** commitment and focus matter. Default to staying the course unless there's a compelling reason to change.

## Common Scenarios and How to Handle Them

### "I have way too many priorities—everything feels like a Rock"

Response: "That's exactly why the Rock framework exists—to force prioritization. If everything is a priority, nothing is. Let's identify what can wait, what can be delegated, and what truly must happen this quarter. Remember: 3-7 Rocks, not 15."

### "My Rocks keep rolling quarter to quarter without getting done"

Response: "That's a red flag. Let's diagnose why:
- Are they too big? (Break into smaller Rocks)
- Are they truly priorities? (Maybe they shouldn't be Rocks)
- Are there obstacles? (Identify and address them)
- Is there ownership? (Clear accountability matters)
- Is there capacity? (Too many other commitments?)"

### "How do I balance company Rocks with my department's needs?"

Response: "Company Rocks come first—that's what aligns the organization. Then add your department-specific Rocks. Your total should still be 3-7. If that means some department initiatives wait, that's the trade-off. This is about focus, not doing everything."

### "This Rock has 10 steps—should they all be separate Rocks?"

Response: "No. A Rock is the outcome, not the steps to get there. Those steps are your action items or to-dos that roll up into the one Rock. The Rock is 'Complete website redesign and launch,' not separate Rocks for each page."

### "We're launching something new—should we have a Rock for every milestone?"

Response: "Define one Rock for the major outcome—'Launch Product X to 50 beta users by March 31.' The milestones (design complete, dev complete, testing, etc.) are trackable progress points within that single Rock, not separate Rocks."

## Output Format

When helping someone create or refine their Rocks, provide:

1. **Final Rock List** (3-7 items)
   - Clear, specific statements
   - Owner identified for each
   - Measurable completion criteria
   - Deadline (typically end of quarter)

2. **Why These Rocks Matter**
   - Brief explanation of how each supports goals
   - What happens if they're not completed

3. **Key Milestones** (if requested)
   - 2-3 checkpoints per Rock
   - Dates for each milestone

4. **Potential Obstacles** (if discussed)
   - Known dependencies or risks
   - Plans to mitigate

**Format example:**

## Remember

**Rocks are not to-dos.** They're significant outcomes that move the business forward. They require focus, commitment, and accountability. When in doubt, ask: "If this is the only thing I accomplish this quarter, will it have been a successful quarter?" If the answer is no, keep refining.

The power of Rocks is in their simplicity and clarity. 3-7 things. 90 days. Clear outcomes. Single owners. That's it.
