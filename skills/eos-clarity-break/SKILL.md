# EOS Clarity Break

An EOS Clarity Break is a structured session where leaders deliberately step away from day-to-day operations to think strategically, gain clarity on issues, and generate breakthrough ideas. This skill guides users through a comprehensive Clarity Break session.

## Session Overview

A Clarity Break typically takes 60-90 minutes and follows this structure:

1. **Setup & Grounding** (5-10 min)
2. **State Assessment** (10-15 min)
3. **Issue Identification** (15-20 min)
4. **Deep Dive Thinking** (20-30 min)
5. **Action Planning** (10-15 min)
6. **Documentation & Closure** (5-10 min)

## Conducting the Clarity Break

Guide users through each phase conversationally and interactively. Ask questions, listen deeply, and help them think through their responses. Do not rush through phases - give space for reflection.

### Phase 1: Setup & Grounding (5-10 minutes)

Begin by helping the user transition from operational mode to strategic thinking mode.

**Opening questions:**
- "What prompted you to take a Clarity Break today?"
- "Before we begin, take a moment to settle in. What's your current mental state?"
- "What's been occupying most of your headspace lately?"

**Set the session context:**
- Confirm the user has uninterrupted time (suggest 60-90 minutes)
- Remind them this is a judgment-free zone for honest thinking
- Explain that the goal is clarity, not necessarily solutions

### Phase 2: State Assessment (10-15 minutes)

Help the user assess where they and their organization currently stand.

**Explore these dimensions systematically:**

**Business Health:**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how healthy does the business feel right now?"
- "What's working really well?"
- "What's not working or causing friction?"

**Personal Energy:**
- "How are you feeling as a leader right now?"
- "What's energizing you? What's draining you?"
- "Are you working on the right things?"

**Team Dynamics:**
- "How is your team performing?"
- "Where is there alignment? Where is there misalignment?"
- "Are the right people in the right seats?"

**Vision Clarity:**
- "How clear are you on where the organization is headed?"
- "Is everyone aligned on that vision?"

Listen for patterns, tensions, and areas of concern. Reflect back what you're hearing.

### Phase 3: Issue Identification (15-20 minutes)

Help the user identify and prioritize the issues that need attention.

**Generate the issue list:**
- "What issues or challenges have come up in your reflection so far?"
- "What's been keeping you up at night?"
- "What opportunities are you not pursuing that you should be?"
- "What decisions are you avoiding?"

**For each issue mentioned, capture:**
- A clear statement of the issue
- Why it matters (impact)
- What happens if it's not addressed

**Prioritize:**
Once you have a list of issues (aim for 5-10), help prioritize:
- "Which of these issues, if solved, would have the biggest impact?"
- "Which are most urgent?"
- "Which are root causes vs. symptoms?"

Identify the top 2-3 issues to explore deeply.

### Phase 4: Deep Dive Thinking (20-30 minutes)

For each priority issue, guide deep strategic thinking.

**For each priority issue, explore:**

**Understanding:**
- "Let's dig into [issue]. What's really going on here?"
- "What are the underlying causes?"
- "What assumptions are we making?"
- "What patterns do you notice?"

**Perspectives:**
- "How would your team see this issue?"
- "How would your customers see it?"
- "What would a completely fresh perspective reveal?"
- "What's the opposite way to think about this?"

**Possibilities:**
- "What if you had unlimited resources - what would you do?"
- "What if this issue didn't exist - what would be different?"
- "What's the boldest move you could make?"
- "What small change could create a big impact?"

**Obstacles:**
- "What's really stopping progress on this?"
- "What fears or concerns are present?"
- "What trade-offs are involved?"

Encourage the user to think freely without immediately jumping to solutions. Create space for breakthrough insights.

### Phase 5: Action Planning (10-15 minutes)

Help translate insights into concrete next steps.

**For each issue explored, identify:**

**Key Insights:**
- "What did you realize or learn about this issue?"
- "What shifted in your thinking?"
- "What became clearer?"

**Potential Solutions:**
- "What are 2-3 possible approaches?"
- "What's the simplest solution?"
- "What's the most impactful solution?"

**Next Actions:**
- "What's the very next action you need to take?"
- "Who needs to be involved?"
- "What's the timeline?"
- "What do you need to say no to in order to say yes to this?"

**Help create an action plan with:**
- 3-5 clear next actions
- Owners (even if it's just the user)
- Timeframes (specific dates when possible)

### Phase 6: Documentation & Closure (5-10 minutes)

Help the user capture and commit to their clarity.

**Summarize the session:**
Create a clear summary document that includes:

1. **State Assessment Summary:**
   - Key reflections on business health, personal energy, team dynamics, vision

2. **Issues Identified:**
   - Full list of issues surfaced
   - Top 2-3 priority issues

3. **Key Insights:**
   - Breakthrough realizations
   - Shifts in thinking
   - New perspectives gained

4. **Action Items:**
   - Specific next steps with owners and dates
   - Decisions made
   - Things to stop doing

5. **Follow-up:**
   - When to revisit these issues
   - When to schedule the next Clarity Break

**Closing questions:**
- "How do you feel now compared to when we started?"
- "What's the most important thing you're taking away from this session?"
- "What's your level of commitment to these action items?"
- "When will you schedule your next Clarity Break?"

Offer to create a document capturing all of this in a format they can reference and share with their team as appropriate.

## Facilitation Principles

**Be conversational, not robotic:** Guide the session naturally. Don't just list questions - engage in dialogue.

**Listen actively:** Reflect back what you're hearing. Notice patterns. Ask follow-up questions.

**Create space:** Don't rush. Allow silence for thinking. Some of the best insights come from pauses.

**Challenge gently:** If something doesn't add up or seems like avoidance, ask about it with curiosity.

**Stay focused:** If the user goes too tactical or gets pulled into operational details, gently redirect to strategic thinking.

**Encourage honesty:** This is a safe space for hard truths. Normalize difficulty and complexity.

**Document progressively:** As insights and action items emerge, capture them so the user doesn't have to hold everything in their head.

## Variations

**Short Clarity Break (30 minutes):**
Focus on one specific issue. Skip broad state assessment and move quickly to issue deep dive.

**Team Clarity Break:**
If working with a team, emphasize collective insights, diverse perspectives, and shared commitment to actions.

**Quarterly Review Clarity Break:**
Incorporate review of previous quarter's goals, metrics, and learnings before moving into standard process.

## When to Adapt

- If the user seems stuck, shift to more creative prompts ("What would you do if failure wasn't possible?")
- If energy is low, focus on what's working well first to build momentum
- If the user is action-oriented and gets frustrated with reflection, move to action planning sooner
- If breakthrough insights emerge early, follow that thread rather than rigidly following the structure
