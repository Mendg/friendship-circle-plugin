# Friendship Circle Communications

## Core Mission

Friendship Circle International empowers children, teens, and adults with disabilities through friendship and inclusion. All communications should reflect this mission: people with disabilities deserve friendship, community, acceptance, and to be treated as regular people—not defined by their disability.

## Voice & Tone Principles

### The Authentic Voice
- Write like Mendel Groner: personal, vulnerable, relatable
- Conversational and raw—like talking to a friend, not a donor database
- Story-driven with real moments and real people
- Jewish soul-centered when appropriate (B"H, Shabbat, holidays feel natural)
- Emotional without being manipulative
- Urgent without being desperate

### Core Formula
**Emotion leads → Clarity closes → Urgency converts**

Never flip this order. Start with feeling, then explain the impact, then create urgency for action.

## Storytelling Structure

### Hook-Problem-Transformation Pattern
1. **Hook:** Start with a surprising statement, question, or vulnerable admission
   - "Of course she couldn't go to college"
   - "I wish I never joined"
   - "I'm so excited for Yom Kippur" (when unexpected)

2. **Problem/Before:** Show the before state—what life looked like without Friendship Circle
   - Emma couldn't imagine college
   - The teen carrying "high school scoreboard" weight
   - Someone stuck at home without friends

3. **Transformation/After:** Show what changed through friendship
   - Emma got a full scholarship
   - Teens can breathe and be themselves
   - Real friendships that change life trajectory

4. **Your Role:** Make the donor/participant the hero
   - "You can be the key that unlocks potential"
   - "People like you aren't ready to settle for just that"
   - "Your support makes this possible"

5. **Clear Ask:** Specific action with urgency
   - Dollar amounts: "$300 = three months of friendship"
   - Deadlines: "before the end of the year," "registration closes Monday"
   - Easy next step: link, code, simple CTA

## The Ask

### Always Include:
- **Specific dollar amounts** with tangible impact
  - Good: "$1,200 = one year of friendship"
  - Bad: "Any amount helps"

- **Urgency anchors**
  - Deadlines: "before Dec 31," "closes in 52 hours"
  - Matching gifts: "every dollar doubled until [date]"
  - Limited spots: "we need 12 donors before Shabbos"

- **Clear action**
  - "Give here," "Register with code LIFTOFF," "Click to donate"
  - Never: "Learn more," "Consider giving," "Check it out"

### Framing Donor Upgrades
When asking previous donors to increase giving:
- Reference their previous gift naturally ("You donated $1,000 last year")
- Frame increase as expanded partnership, not "more money"
- Make it feel like progression: "Would you consider matching or exceeding..."
- Show what the increased amount enables (bigger impact, not just bigger number)

## Style Guidelines

### DO:
- Use real stories with real names (Emma, Noemi, Emmi)
- Include direct quotes from participants
- Write in short paragraphs for readability
- Use "you" language—make it about the reader
- Acknowledge nervousness, doubts, real feelings
- Use Jewish references naturally (Shabbat, holidays, blessings)
- Create relatable moments ("You know those WhatsApp groups you rarely check?")
- Build to the P.S. with additional urgency or sweetener

### DON'T:
- Use jargon or corporate nonprofit language
- Write in passive voice
- Make abstract claims without stories
- Guilt-trip or manipulate
- Use clichés ("drop in the bucket," "change the world")
- Be vague about impact or amounts
- Forget the urgency element

## Email Structure Best Practices

### Subject Lines
- Surprising or vulnerable: "I wish I never joined"
- Personal and direct: "You're the best ❤️"
- Relatable scenarios: "She rarely checks that WhatsApp group"
- Unexpected statements: "I'm so excited for Yom Kippur"

### Opening
- Hook immediately—no warm-up paragraphs
- Start with a story, question, or vulnerable admission
- Make them curious enough to keep reading

### Body
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- One main story or through-line
- Build emotional connection before making the ask
- Show transformation, not just need

### The Ask
- Clear, specific, urgent
- Include multiple giving levels when appropriate
- Make it easy (one click, one code, one action)

### P.S.
- Add urgency (deadline, matching gift)
- Offer reassurance ("You can drop out," "No commitment until...")
- Additional benefit or sweetener

## Types of Communications

### End-of-Year Appeals
- Tax deadline urgency is natural
- Matching gifts create urgency
- "Before the end of the year" deadline works
- See references/email_examples.md for Emma's story and Yom Kippur examples

### Personal Donor Communications
- Reference their specific previous gift
- Thank them genuinely first
- Connect to current need or opportunity
- Keep tone warm and grateful
- See references/email_examples.md for upgrade ask example

### Team Friendship Event Recruitment
- Focus on transformation, not just fitness
- Emphasize community and experience
- Include participant quotes and stories
- Address common hesitations directly
- Make registration feel low-risk
- See references/email_examples.md for multiple recruitment examples

### Monthly Giving
- Frame as ongoing partnership
- Show sustained impact over time
- Make monthly amount feel manageable
- Emphasize being part of something continuous

### Donor Reactivation
- Acknowledge the gap without guilt
- Remind them of their previous impact
- Show what's new or what they'd be returning to
- Make it easy to come back

## Psychological Principles

### Make the Donor the Hero
The participant/donor isn't helping from the sidelines—they're actively creating friendship and proving what's possible. They're unlocking potential, changing trajectories, showing people they matter.

### Identity Framing
"People like you" language creates identity:
- "People like you aren't ready to settle for just that"
- "You're the type of person who shows up"
- "Donors like you make this possible"

### Loss Aversion
Frame what happens without action:
- "Of course she wasn't going to college" (before)
- "Every day we wait, a child goes another night without a friend"
- Life trajectories that don't change without support

### Social Proof
Use specific examples and quotes:
- "@modestmom" testimonials
- "Thousands of runners have joined"
- Real participant experiences

### Transformation Over Transaction
Always frame around transformation:
- Not "we need money" but "you can change Emma's life trajectory"
- Not "donate to our program" but "give the gift of friendship"
- Not "support our work" but "unlock potential they know they have"

## Jewish Community Context

### Natural References
- B"H at the top of emails
- Shabbat, holidays, Jewish values woven in naturally
- Blessings that feel genuine, not performative
- "Shavua Tov!" greetings
- Divine providence, nachas, spiritual language when appropriate

### Holiday Connections
Tie appeals to Jewish holidays meaningfully:
- Yom Kippur: being seen for who you are
- Chanukah: adding light to the world
- Use holidays to illuminate universal themes (acceptance, identity, belonging)

## For Reference

See references/email_examples.md for full examples across all communication types. Study how these emails:
- Hook immediately
- Build emotional connection through story
- Make the donor the hero
- Include specific asks with urgency
- Feel personal and conversational
- Use Jewish context naturally

## Remember

Every communication should answer:
1. Why does this matter emotionally?
2. What transformation happens?
3. How does the donor/participant become the hero?
4. What specific action should they take?
5. Why should they act now?

Write communications that make people feel something before asking them to do anything.
