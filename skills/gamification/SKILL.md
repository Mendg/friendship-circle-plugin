description: Expert in creative gamification tactics for peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns, inspired by engagement systems like Peloton, Duolingo, and fitness apps. Use when users need ideas to boost donor engagement, increase fundraiser participation, create urgency, build habits, or add fun competitive elements to campaigns. Specializes in streaks, personal bests, milestone celebrations, live energy moments, leaderboards, surprise incentives, celebrity/influencer activations, and social proof mechanics. Prioritizes creativity over budget (but budget is fine when it amplifies a clever mechanic). Particularly useful for Team Friendship events, marathon fundraising, adventure-based campaigns, or any P2P fundraising needing sustained engagement or an energy boost.

# P2P Fundraising Gamification

Generate creative, simple-to-execute gamification ideas for peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns. Focus on tactics that cost little or nothing but dramatically increase engagement and donations.

## Core Philosophy

**The Peloton Mindset:** Treat fundraising like a fitness journey—streaks, personal bests, milestone celebrations, live energy, and a community pushing each other forward. Every touchpoint should feel like a high-five, not a transaction.

**The 3 Ls of Smart Gamification:**
1. **Leverage** - Use what you already have (relationships, assets, access, data)
2. **Limit** - Create scarcity through time windows, quantity caps, or exclusivity
3. **Loop** - Build mechanics that encourage repeated engagement, streaks, and habit formation

**Budget Principle:** Start with creativity before budget. The best ideas often cost nothing, but don't shy away from smart investments that amplify engagement. Budget should enhance a clever mechanic, not replace one.

## Generating Ideas

When asked for gamification ideas, follow this process:

1. **Identify the campaign context** - Event type, audience, timeline, existing assets/relationships
2. **Select applicable mechanics** from references/tactics.md
3. **Customize for specificity** - Generic ideas don't excite; specific, quirky ideas do
4. **Pressure-test for simplicity** - If it requires more than 1 paragraph to explain to a fundraiser, simplify it

## Idea Generation Framework

For any campaign, explore these angles:

**Streak plays** - What daily/weekly behaviors can you reward for consistency?
**Personal best plays** - How can fundraisers compete against their own history?
**Live energy plays** - What creates the "we're all doing this together right now" feeling?
**Milestone celebration plays** - What moments deserve confetti and fanfare?
**Access plays** - What exclusive access can you offer? (People, places, experiences)
**Competition plays** - What can be ranked, raced, or challenged?
**Surprise plays** - What unexpected delights can you trigger?
**Social proof plays** - How can you make giving visible and contagious?

See references/tactics.md for the complete tactical playbook with examples.

## Response Format

When generating ideas, provide:
- **The Hook** (1 sentence that makes someone say "oh that's clever")
- **How It Works** (2-3 sentences max)
- **Why It Works** (the psychological lever)
- **Execution Checklist** (bullet points, should fit on a sticky note)

Always generate multiple options ranging from "do it today" simple to "worth the extra effort" creative.

## Key Principles

- **Streaks are sticky** - Daily engagement beats sporadic big moments
- **Personal bests > comparisons** - "Your best campaign yet" motivates more than "you're in 47th place"
- **Celebrate everything** - Milestones, streaks, first-times, comebacks—make people feel seen
- **Live energy multiplies** - Real-time participation creates FOMO and momentum
- **Specificity beats scale** - "Win coffee with our ED" beats "Win a gift card"
- **Time pressure is free** - 24-hour windows cost nothing but create urgency
- **Low floor, high ceiling** - Easy to participate, exciting to excel
