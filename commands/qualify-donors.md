# Qualify Donors

Help me prioritize my donor outreach.

I'll provide: $ARGUMENTS

Use the donor-pipeline agent to:

1. **Qualify each contact** by:
   - Giving history and recency
   - Gift amount trends
   - Engagement signals
   - Connection strength

2. **Prioritize into tiers**:
   - **Call Today**: Highest probability + highest potential (5-10)
   - **Call This Week**: Strong candidates (10-20)
   - **Nurture Queue**: Need cultivation first
   - **Research Needed**: Missing information

3. **For "Call Today" contacts**, provide:
   - Why they're prioritized
   - Personalized opening line
   - Recommended ask amount
   - Likely objections and responses
   - Best channel to reach them

If I haven't provided a list yet, ask me to paste donor data or describe who I'm trying to reach.
