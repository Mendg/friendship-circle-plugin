# Recruit for Team Friendship

Help me recruit participants for Team Friendship.

Event/Context: $ARGUMENTS

Use the recruitment agent to:

1. **If I've provided lead info**, generate personalized outreach including:
   - Custom subject line for their motivation
   - Opening that references something specific about them
   - Event pitch addressing their likely objections
   - Social proof from similar participants
   - Clear next step
   - P.S. addressing their hesitation

2. **If I need recruitment strategy**, help me:
   - Identify target segments
   - Build messaging for each segment
   - Plan outreach sequence
   - Identify the right messengers

3. **For objection handling**, prepare responses for:
   - "I'm not a runner/athlete"
   - "I can't raise that much"
   - "I don't have time"
   - "It's too expensive"
   - "I'm nervous about the challenge"

Remember: Transformation over achievement. Community over competition. Address the real objection (usually fundraising fear).
