# Plan Team Friendship Event

Help me design a transformational fundraising event.

Event: $ARGUMENTS

Use the event-planner agent to:

1. **Define the transformation goal**
   - What realization should participants have?
   - Design backward from the finish line moment

2. **Build the five transformation levers**:
   - Shabbos as spiritual container
   - Beneficiary story integration
   - Cheering squad at breaking point
   - Community through intentional friction
   - Fundraising as relationship discovery

3. **Create detailed logistics**:
   - Schedule (hour-by-hour)
   - Venue/location requirements
   - Staffing needs
   - Content moments to capture
   - Risk mitigation

4. **Plan post-event stewardship**:
   - Immediate follow-up
   - Content release timeline
   - Re-recruitment seeding

If I haven't specified an event type, ask me:
- What kind of event? (marathon, mountain, bike, etc.)
- Where and when?
- Expected participants?
- Any specific constraints?
