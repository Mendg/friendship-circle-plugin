# Draft Appeal

Help me write a fundraising appeal or donor communication.

I need to write a $ARGUMENTS

Please ask me:
1. Who is the audience? (donor segment, giving history, relationship level)
2. What's the goal? (specific amount, action, or relationship outcome)
3. What's the urgency? (deadline, match, milestone)
4. Any specific story or hook to use?

Then use the appeal-writer agent to create a full draft with:
- 3 subject line options
- Complete email following emotion → clarity → urgency structure
- Suggested send time
- Follow-up sequence recommendation

Remember: Write like Mendel—personal, vulnerable, story-driven. No corporate nonprofit language.
