# Gamify Campaign

Generate creative gamification ideas for a fundraising campaign.

Campaign/Context: $ARGUMENTS

Using the gamification skill, explore these angles:

1. **Streak plays** - Daily/weekly behaviors to reward for consistency
2. **Personal best plays** - Competing against their own history
3. **Live energy plays** - "We're all doing this together right now" moments
4. **Milestone celebration plays** - What deserves confetti?
5. **Access plays** - Exclusive access to people, places, experiences
6. **Competition plays** - What can be ranked, raced, or challenged?
7. **Surprise plays** - Unexpected delights
8. **Social proof plays** - Making giving visible and contagious

For each idea, provide:
- **The Hook** (1 sentence that makes someone say "oh that's clever")
- **How It Works** (2-3 sentences max)
- **Why It Works** (the psychological lever)
- **Execution Checklist** (bullet points, fits on a sticky note)

Generate options ranging from "do it today" simple to "worth the extra effort" creative.

Remember: The 3 Ls - Leverage (use what you have), Limit (create scarcity), Loop (encourage repeated engagement).
