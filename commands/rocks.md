# EOS Rocks

Help me with quarterly Rocks (90-day priorities).

Context: $ARGUMENTS

Using the EOS Rocks skill:

**If creating new Rocks:**
1. Discovery - Surface 10-20 potential priorities through strategic questions
2. Evaluation - Assess each for impact, feasibility, and clarity
3. Prioritization - Narrow to 3-7 final Rocks
4. Refinement - Make each crystal clear with SMART criteria
5. Assignment - Clarify ownership and milestones

**If reviewing existing Rocks:**
- Are they on track, off track, or at risk?
- Do any need adjustment?
- Are they still the right priorities?

**Output format:**
```
## Q[X] 2025 Rocks

1. **Owner:** [Name]
   **Rock:** [Action verb] [specific outcome] [measurable criteria] by [deadline]
   **Why it matters:** [Connection to annual goals]
   **Milestones:** [2-3 checkpoints with dates]
```

**Remember:**
- Rocks are outcomes, not activities
- 3-7 Rocks, not 15
- Binary done/not done
- Single owner per Rock
- If it takes less than a week, it's a to-do, not a Rock
