# Clarity Break

Guide me through a Clarity Break session.

Focus area: $ARGUMENTS

Using the EOS Clarity Break skill, help me:

1. **Clear the mental space**
   - What's weighing on you right now?
   - What can be set aside for this session?

2. **Surface the real issue**
   - What are you actually trying to solve?
   - Is this the root issue or a symptom?

3. **Explore strategically**
   - What would this look like if it were easy?
   - What's the 10x solution, not the 10% improvement?
   - What would you do if you couldn't fail?

4. **Identify next actions**
   - What's the one thing that would make everything else easier?
   - What's the smallest step you can take today?

5. **Capture the clarity**
   - What did you realize?
   - What decisions did you make?
   - What will you do differently?

This is protected thinking time. No phones, no interruptions, no rushing to solutions.
